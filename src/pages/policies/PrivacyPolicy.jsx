                This Privacy Statement applies to the Personal Data collected, processed, and stored by StickyHR’s HRMS. It covers all platforms, applications, websites, and services provided or owned by Sticky HR Solutions Pvt Ltd that involve the handling of Personal Data.

                What Does StickyHR’s Privacy Statement Cover?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Data protection laws in various jurisdictions distinguish between “Controllers” and “Processors” of Personal Information. A Controller decides why and how to process Personal Information, while a Processor only processes information on behalf of a Controller based on their instructions. StickyHR may act as either a Controller or a Processor, depending on the scenario. <br />
                This Privacy Statement applies when StickyHR is the Data Controller of your Personal Information (unless a different StickyHR privacy statement is displayed when we collect your information). It explains how StickyHR collects, uses, and shares your Personal Information for its own purposes. For example, this Privacy Statement covers when you:

                <li>Create or use an account offered directly by StickyHR.</li>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
